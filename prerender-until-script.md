# Explainer: The `prerender_until_script` Speculation Rule

## Introduction

This document proposes a new action for the Speculation Rules API, `prerender_until_script`. This action is designed to provide developers with an intermediate option between the existing `prefetch` and `prerender` actions.

The Speculation Rules API currently offers two main actions: `prefetch`, which only fetches the main document, and `prerender`, which fetches and fully renders the page, including executing all scripts. While both are powerful, developers have expressed a desire for a middle ground that provides more performance benefits than `prefetch` without the full resource commitment and immediate script execution of `prerender`.

For some pages, executing JavaScript during the prerendering phase can be unnecessary or premature. For example, scripts for analytics, ads, or third-party widgets might be better deferred until the user has actively navigated to the page.

The `prerender_until_script` action fills this gap. It provides the network and parsing benefits of prerenderingâ€”fetching the main document and allowing the browser's preload scanner to discover and download critical subresources, while deferring all script execution until activation. This gives developers a new level of control to fine-tune their performance strategies.

## Goals

*   Introduce an intermediate speculation action between `prefetch` and `prerender`.
*   Provide a mechanism to prerender a page without executing any JavaScript until the page is activated.
*   Allow developers to gain the performance benefits of fetching and parsing a page and its subresources, without the cost of early script execution.
*   Give developers more granular control over the performance-versus-resource-usage tradeoff.
*   Enable a "progressive speculation" strategy, where a `prerender_until_script` can be used with an `eager` or `moderate` eagerness, and a full `prerender` can be used with a `conservative` eagerness.
*   Maintain the security and privacy benefits of the existing prerendering framework.

## Key Scenarios / Use Cases

*   **Content sites with heavy interactive elements:** A news article or blog post could be prerendered to display the text content instantly, while the JavaScript for comments sections, social media widgets, and other interactive elements is deferred until the user activates the page.
*   **E-commerce product pages:** A product page could be prerendered to show the main product image and description, while scripts for engagement calculation and conversion tracking are paused until the user navigates to the page.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a new action, `prerender_until_script`, which can be used within a `<script type="speculationrules">` element. When the browser processes a speculation rule with this action, it will initiate a prerender that:

1.  Fetches the document.
2.  Parses the HTML and constructs the DOM. The user agent's preload scanner can discover and begin downloading subresources (e.g., stylesheets, images) referenced in the document.
3.  Renders the page. If a parser-blocking `<script>` element is encountered, rendering will be paused at that point until activation.
4.  Pauses all script execution. This includes `<script>` blocks, timers, and promise resolutions.
5.  When the user navigates to the prerendered page, the page is activated, and all paused scripts are executed in order.

### Example

```html
<!-- initiator.html -->
<script type="speculationrules">
{
  "prerender_until_script": [
    {
      "source": "list",
      "urls": ["/heavy-script-page.html"]
    }
  ]
}
</script>

<a href="/heavy-script-page.html">Link to a page with heavy scripts</a>
```

```html
<!-- heavy-script-page.html -->
<script defer scr="deferred-script.js" id="deferred-script"></script>
<script async src="async-script.js" id="async-script"></script>
<img src="image1.jpg" id="first-image"/>
<script id="first-blocking">
{
  // Heavy script... 
}
</script>
<img src="image2.jpg"/>

```

In this example, `/heavy-script-page.html` will be prerendered, but its scripts will not run until the user clicks the link and the page is activated.

More specifically, the user agent processes the page as follows:

1.  The `deferred-script` script is parsed and added to the queue of scripts that will be executed after page parsing is complete. Parsing then resumes.
2.  The `async-script` script is parsed and added to the queue of scripts that will be executed after prerender activation. Parsing then resumes.
3.  The `first-image` element is parsed, `image1.jpg` is fetched and loaded, and parsing resumes.
4.  When the `first-blocking` script is parsed, the parser pauses and waits for prerender activation.
5.  While waiting for activation, the user agent may optionally prefetch `image2.jpg`.
6.  The prerendered document is activated.
7.  The parsing of `first-blocking` script resumes, and the script is executed.
 
## Detailed Design Discussion

The `prerender_until_script` action is implemented as an extension to the existing prerendering specification. The key technical changes are:

*   A new `prerender_until_script rules` list is added to the `speculation rule set` struct.
*   A `scripts paused` boolean is added to the `prerender candidate` struct to track whether scripts should be paused.
*   A `scripting mode` is added to the `navigable` struct, with a state of `paused-until-activation`.
*   When a page is prerendered with `prerender_until_script`, all script execution is paused. This means that no `<script>` tags are executed, and no timers or promises are allowed to execute their callbacks. The JavaScript engine is effectively "frozen" until the document is activated. Upon activation, script execution resumes as if there was no interruption.
*   Upon activation, the `finalize activation` algorithm sets the `scripting mode` to `enabled` and resumes script execution.

## Developer Impact

For developers, this is a powerful new tool for performance optimization. Pages that were previously poor candidates for prerendering due to their reliance on JavaScript can now benefit from this feature.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

The `prerender_until_script` action inherits all the security and privacy protections of the standard prerendering mechanism. All restrictions, such as those on cross-site navigations and access to user-facing APIs, remain in effect.

This feature does not introduce any new security or privacy concerns beyond those already addressed by the prerendering specification. By deferring script execution until activation, it offers a model with a more limited execution context during the speculation phase, which can be a desirable characteristic for some applications.

## Considered Alternatives

### No Prerendering

The simplest alternative is to not prerender pages with heavy scripts. However, this means that users navigating to these pages will not experience the performance benefits of prerendering. `prerender_until_script` provides a better option by allowing the most time-consuming parts of the page load (network and parsing) to be done in advance.

### Modifying Pages to be Prerender-Friendly

Another alternative is for developers to modify their pages to be more "prerender-friendly," for example, by delaying script execution manually using the `prerenderingchange` event. While this is a valid approach, `prerender_until_script` provides a simpler, declarative way to achieve a similar result without requiring significant code changes. It also provides a stronger guarantee that *no* scripts will be executed, which can be difficult to achieve manually.

### Alternative Naming

The initial proposal for this feature used the name `preparse`. Other names, such as `prescan` and `prefetch_with_subresources`, were also considered. The name `prerender_until_script` was chosen to make it clear that this is a form of prerendering, but with a specific modification to the script execution lifecycle. This naming helps to place the feature within the existing mental model of the Speculation Rules API.
