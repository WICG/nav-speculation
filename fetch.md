# Prerendering fetching modes

Placeholder. TODO.

Some text from Jeremy's doc:

First, consider the __fetch__ of the resource. User agents would ideally prefetch the content in a way that does not identify the user. For example, the user agent could:

* send a request without credentials (e.g., no `Cookie` or `Authorization` request header)
* establish the connection from a different client IP address (e.g., using a proxy server or virtual private network, if available)
* use a previously fetched response, including one previously fetched by a third party if it can be authenticated
