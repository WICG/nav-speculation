# Chrome Origin Trial for same-origin prerendering

Google Chrome offered an [origin trial](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md) of [same-origin prerendering](./prerendering-same-site.md) triggered by the [Speculation Rules API](./triggers.md), from Chrome 94 through 102.

However, the trial is now concluded, and this feature is launched!
