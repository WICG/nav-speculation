Explainer: Adding prefetchCache and prerenderCache Values to Clear-Site-Data Header
Introduction and Motivation
The Clear-Site-Data header is a powerful tool for web developers to clear various types of data stored by a website. Currently, the cache value of this header includes the functionality to evict prefetches and cancel prerenders. However, there is a need for more granular control to allow developers to specifically target these actions without affecting other cached data.

Problem Statement
While the cache value in the Clear-Site-Data header provides a broad mechanism to clear cached data, it lacks the specificity required for certain use cases. Developers may want to clear prefetches and prerenders independently of other cached data to optimize performance and resource usage. This lack of granularity can lead to unnecessary clearing of data, which may negatively impact user experience and performance.

Goals
Introduce prefetchCache and prerenderCache values to the Clear-Site-Data header.
Allow developers to specifically target the eviction of prefetches and the cancellation of prerenders.
Maintain backward compatibility with the existing cache value.
Non-Goals
Modifying the behavior of the existing cache value.
Introducing new types of data to be cleared beyond prefetches and prerenders.
Key Use-Cases
Optimizing Resource Usage: Developers can clear prefetches and prerenders without affecting other cached data, leading to more efficient resource usage.
Improving Performance: By targeting specific caches, developers can avoid the performance overhead associated with clearing all cached data.
Enhanced Control: Provides developers with finer control over the data cleared by their applications, allowing for more precise optimizations.
Proposed Solution
We propose adding two new values to the Clear-Site-Data header: prefetchCache and prerenderCache. These values will allow developers to clear prefetches and prerenders independently of other cached data.

Example Code

In this example, the prefetchCache value will clear all prefetches, and the prerenderCache value will cancel all prerenders.

Alternative Designs
Single Value for Both Actions
An alternative design considered was to introduce a single value that would clear both prefetches and prerenders. However, this approach was deemed less flexible and did not provide the granularity required by developers.

Extending the cache Value
Another alternative was to extend the functionality of the existing cache value to include more granular control. This approach was rejected to maintain backward compatibility and avoid potential confusion.

Conclusion
The addition of prefetchCache and prerenderCache values to the Clear-Site-Data header provides developers with the necessary granularity to optimize resource usage and improve performance. This change aligns with the goal of providing more precise control over the data cleared by web applications.
