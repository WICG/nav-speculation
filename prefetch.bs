<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

In light of <a href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-partitioning/">storage partitioning</a>, this specification defines prefetch for navigations which would occur within the same partition (for example, top-level navigations within the same site) and for navigations which would occur in a separate partition (for example, top-level navigations to a different site).

Each {{Document}} has a <dfn export>prefetch buffer</dfn>, which is a [=list=] of [=prefetch records=].

A <dfn>prefetch record</dfn> is a [=struct=] with the following [=struct/items=]:
* <dfn export for="prefetch record">URL</dfn>, a [=URL=]
* <dfn export for="prefetch record">referrer policy</dfn>, a [=referrer policy=]
* <dfn export for="prefetch record">response</dfn>, a [=response=]
* <dfn export for="prefetch record">expiry time</dfn>, a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}

<p class="issue">Does the prefetch record need to contain redirect info, e.g. to verify that all redirects would pass `navigate-to`?</p>

The user agent may remove elements from the [=prefetch buffer=] even if they are not expired, e.g., due to resource constraints. Since records with expiry times in the past are never returned, they can be removed with no observable consequences.

<div algorithm="store a prefetch record">
    To <dfn export>store a prefetch record</dfn> given a {{Document}} |document|, [=URL=] |url|, [=referrer policy=] |referrerPolicy| and [=response=] |response|, perform the following steps.

    1. [=Assert=]: |document| is [=Document/fully active=].
    1. Let |currentTime| be the [=current high resolution time=] for the [=relevant global object=] of |document|.
    1. Let |expiryTime| be |currentTime| + 300000 (i.e., five minutes).
    1. [=list/Remove=] all elements whose [=prefetch record/URL=] equals |url| and [=prefetch record/referrer policy=] equals |referrerPolicy| from |document|'s [=prefetch buffer=].
    1. [=list/Append=] a [=prefetch record=] with [=prefetch record/URL=] |url|, [=prefetch record/referrer policy=] |referrerPolicy|, [=prefetch record/response=] |response| and [=prefetch record/expiry time=] |expiryTime| to |document|'s [=prefetch buffer=].
</div>

<div algorithm="find a matching prefetch response">
    To <dfn export>find a matching prefetch response</dfn> given a {{Document}} |document|, [=URL=] |url| and [=referrer policy=] |referrerPolicy|, perform the following steps.

    1. [=Assert=]: |document| is [=Document/fully active=].
    1. Let |currentTime| be the [=current high resolution time=] for the [=relevant global object=] of |document|.
    1. [=list/For each=] |record| of |document|'s [=prefetch buffer=]:
        1. If |record|'s [=prefetch record/URL=] is not equal to |url| or |record|'s [=prefetch record/referrer policy=] is not equal to |referrerPolicy|, then [=iteration/continue=].
        1. [=list/Remove=] |record| from |document|'s [=prefetch buffer=].
        1. If |record|'s [=prefetch record/expiry time=] is less than |currentTime|, return null.
        1. Return |record|'s [=prefetch record/response=].
    1. Return null.
    
    <p class="issue">It might be possible to use cache response headers to determine when a response can be used multiple times, but given the short lifetime of the prefetch buffer it's unclear whether this is worthwhile.</p>

<div algorithm="perform a common navigational fetch">
    <div class="note">This is an abstraction of the existing [=process a navigate fetch=]. It includes behavior like redirect handling that is particular to navigational fetches, including those that are relate to a speculate future navigation, rather than an immediate one.</div>

    To <dfn export>perform a common navigational fetch</dfn> given a [=request=] |request|, [=string=] |navigationType|, [=browsing context=] |browsingContext|, [=environment=] or null |forceEnvironment|, algorithm |preRedirectHook| (which takes [=URLs=] currentURL and locationURL) algorithm |shouldBlockNavigationRequest| (which takes a [=request=], navigation type [=string=], and [=environment=], and returns "`Blocked`" or "`Allowed`"), algorithm |shouldBlockNavigationResponse| (which takes a [=request=] and a [=response=], and returns "`Blocked`" or "`Allowed`"), perform the following steps.

    1. Let |response| be null.
    1. Set |request|'s [=request/mode=] to "`navigate`" and [=request/redirect mode=] to "`manual`".
    1. [=Assert=]: |request|'s [=request/reserved client=] is null.
    1. Let |environment| be null.
    1. Let |locationURL| be null.
    1. Let |currentURL| be |request|'s [=request/current URL=].

    1. While true:
        1. If |locationURL| is non-null, then:
            1. Run |preRedirectHook| given |currentURL| and |locationURL|.
            1. Set |currentURL| to |locationURL|.
        1. If |environment| is not null and |currentURL|'s [=url/origin=] is not the [=same origin|same=] as |environment|'s [=environment/creation URL=]'s [=url/origin=], then:
            1. Run the [=environment discarding steps=] for |environment|.
            1. Set |environment| to null.
        1. If |environment| is null, then:
            1. Let |topLevelCreationURL| be |currentURL|.
            1. Let |topLevelOrigin| be null.
            1. If |browsingContext| is not a [=top-level browsing context=], then:
                1. Let |parentEnvironment| be |browsingContext|'s [=browsing context/container=]'s [=relevant settings object=].
                1. Set |topLevelCreationURL| to |parentEnvironment|'s [=environment/top-level creation URL=] and |topLevelOrigin| to |parentEnvironment|'s [=environment/top-level origin=].
            1. Set |environment| to a new [=environment=] whose [=environment/id=] is a unique opaque string, [=environment/target browsing context=] is |browsingContext|, [=environment/creation URL=] is |currentURL|, [=environment/top-level creation URL=] is |topLevelCreationURL|, and [=environment/top-level origin=] is |topLevelOrigin|.
            1. If |forceEnvironment| is null, set |request|'s [=request/reserved client=] to |environment|.
            1. Otherwise, set |request|'s [=request/reserved client=] to |forceEnvironment|.

            <div class="note">These steps ensure that |environment| is an [=environment=] which the correct [=network partition key=], [=environment/active service worker=], etc., depending on whether it's a top-level navigation and if not, what the top-level site is.</div>

        1. If the result of |shouldBlockNavigationRequest| given |request|, |navigationType|, and |environment| is "`Blocked`", then set |response| to a [=network error=] and [=iteration/break=].
        1. If |response| is null, [=fetch=] |request|.
        1. Otherwise, perform [=HTTP-redirect fetch=] using |request| and |response|.
        1. Wait for the [=task=] on the [=networking task source=] to [=process response=] and set |response| to the result.
        1. If the result of |shouldBlockNavigationResponse| given |request| and |response| is "`Blocked`", then set |response| to a [=network error=] and [=iteration/break=].
        1. Set |locationURL| to |response|'s [=response/location URL=] given |currentURL|'s [=url/fragment=].
        1. If |locationURL| is not a [=URL=] whose [=url/scheme=] is an [=HTTP(S) scheme=], the [=iteration/break=].

            <div class="note">
                By the end of this loop we will be in one of these scenarios:
                    * |response| is a [=network error=].
                    * |locationURL| is failure, because of an unparseable `` `Location` `` header.
                    * |locationURL| is null, because we successfully fetched a non-[=network error=] HTTP(S) response with no `` `Location` `` header.

    1. If |forceEnvironment| is not null, run the [=environment discarding steps=] for |environment|.
    1. Return (|response|, |locationURL|).

        <div class="note">This means that if any origin along the redirect chain had credentials, the prefetch is discarded. This reduces the chance of the user observing a logged-out page when they are logged in.</div>
    1. [=Store a prefetch record=] given |document|, |url|, |referrerPolicy| and |response|.

    <div class="issue">This ends up setting the `` `Cache-Control` `` and `` `Pragma` `` request headers, which is contrary to what Chromium does today when skipping cache here. One approach would be to add a flag similar to [=request/prevent no-cache cache-control header modification flag=]. It would also be possible to have a cache that can be copied into the ordinary cache, like Chromium does for cookies.</div>

    <div class="issue">This does not fully address cookie isolation or migration (somewhat complicated by [[FETCH]] not dealing with it), and similar measures with authorization entries, TLS client certificates, and connection pools. This is currently complicated by the fact that even those that are covered by the [=network partition key=] are difficult to address while it's not possible to further partition.</div>

    <div class="issue">Update this to include the `` `Supports-Loading-Mode` `` mechanism to allow responses to continue despite cookies.</div>

    <div class="issue">Further review is needed of the cookies-present handling and its interaction with redirects and caches.</div>
